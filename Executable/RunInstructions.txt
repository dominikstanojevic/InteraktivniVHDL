To start the program enter following line in the command prompt:

java -jar InteraktivniVHDL.jar -init{[signals]} [filename]

-init{[signals]} parameter is optional
[filename] is not optional, all files required for simulation must be placed in this folder

[signals] should be given as [name]=value. If more than one input signal is present, separate
them using commas. For instance -init{a=1,b=111} is valid. Space between signals are not allowed.
